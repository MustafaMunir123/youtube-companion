Thank you for considering contributing to the YouTube Companion project. Before making any contributions, please take a moment to review the following guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository to your GitHub account before making any changes.

2. **Branching**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you work on. This helps keep the main codebase clean and makes it easier to review and merge changes.

3. **Coding Standards**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code and adhere to consistent coding styles throughout the project. For JavaScript, follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.

4. **Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly using comments and docstrings, especially for any complex or non-obvious functionality and update the postman collection.

5. **Testing**: Write tests for new features and ensure all existing tests pass before submitting a pull request. We use the Django test framework for backend testing and Jest for frontend testing.

6. **Pull Requests**: Submit a pull request from your forked repository to the `main` branch of the main project repository. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes and reference any relevant issues.

7. **Code Review**: Be open to feedback and participate in the code review process. This helps maintain code quality and fosters collaboration within the community.
